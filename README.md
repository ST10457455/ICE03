This new feature includes implementing user accounts in which a user can save their frequently used currency pairs, conversion history and preffered settings.

**How to run the Application:**

To run this application, you have to open the program on an SDK, preferrably using Netbeans SDK. open the project and run the program. 

**Usage Guide:**
