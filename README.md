# ICE03

**Project Description:**

For this project, I am enhancing/expanding upon a currency converter application by adding a User 'Authentication and Profiles Feature' to the existing application. This new feature includes implementing user accounts in which a user can save their frequently used currency pairs, conversion history and preffered settings.

**How to run the Application:**

To run this application, Replace the API key in API_ENDPOINT.
Compile and run the CurrencyConvertorTestConsole class for the console version or CurrencyConvertorTest class for the GUI version.

**Usage Guide:**

Firstly the user must create an account by using the Register command, then the user can Login to their account.
After logging in, users can choose between console-based and GUI-based currency conversion.
Both modes allow users to convert currencies, save conversion history, and add favorite pairs.


**Skills Applied:**

Java, Swing, JLayer

**Technologies Used:**

 JLabel, JFrame, JButton, JComboBox, JPanel, JTextField
